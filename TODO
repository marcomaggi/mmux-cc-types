* Implement flonum sign bit mathematical functions.

* See if it  is possible to implement mathematical  root functions, both
  real valued and complex valued.

* See if it is possible to implement mathematical rationalise functions,
  from rational number to numerator and denominator.

* To be considered: should the libc  types be prefixed with "libc"?  For
  example:

    mode -> libc_mode
    pid -> libc_pid
    uid -> libc_uid
    gid -> libc_gid
    off -> libc_off
    rlim -> libc_rlim
    socklen -> libc_socklen
    ino -> libc_ino
    dev -> libc_dev
    nlink -> libc_nlink
    blkcnt -> libc_blkcnt
